just something to write about, nothing more.
do 2 sorts, i'll do merge sort and shell sort.
merging, mainly divide a linked list to linked lists with head but no next by recursion, then merge them.
shell, by step like len/2 then len/4 then ... make smaller linked lists and sort them, do things like merge sort (i think)
