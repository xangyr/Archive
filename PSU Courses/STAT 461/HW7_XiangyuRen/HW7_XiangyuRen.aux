Your homework will consider an experiment on battery life for different types and brands of battery. Two brands (a name brand and a generic brand) of two types (Alkaline and ``Heavy Duty'') of batteries were tested to see how long they could run continuously. This results in four categories, AlkName is for name-brand alkaline batteries, AlkGen is for generic alkaline batteries, HDName is for heavy duty name-brand batteries, and HDGen is for generic heavy duty batteries. Four batteries of each type were tested and the times to battery failure are recorded as below. Use the code below to read in the data:}{section*.1}{}}
