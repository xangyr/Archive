#### Problem (1). Read the data into R and fit the full first order regression model. Write down the estimated regression line. This model will be referred to as model 1 hereafter. Provide any R outputs you might have used.
```{r}
hollywoodData = read.table("HollywoodMovies2011.csv", header = T, sep=",")
FullModel = lm(Profitability ~ RottenTomatoes + AudienceScore + TheatersOpenWeek + BOAverageOpenWeek + DomesticGross, data = hollywoodData)
summary(FullModel)
```

Let's say y is Profitability, $x_1$ is RottenTomatoes, $x_2$ is AudienceScore, $x_3$ is TheatersOpenWeek, $x_4$ is BOAverageOpenWeek, $x_5$ is DomesticGross, and we get the estimated full first order regression model, 
$$\hat y=5.42+0.076x_1-0.096x_2-0.0006x_3-0.00004x_4+0.028x_5$$

#### Problem (2). By looking at the test results for the partial slopes (at 10% level), identify any variables you would like to drop from model 1. Provide reasons for your choice(s). You do not have to write down any steps for hypothesis testing here.

At 10% level, we can drop $x_2$, $x_3$, and $x_4$ from the model, because the p-value of testing for partial slope for
each of these variables are greater than 0.1 which indicates that these variables don't have predictive value after adjusting
for other variables.

#### Problem (3). Re-ft the model by eliminating the variables you decided to drop in part (2). Write down the estimated regression line. This model will be referred to as model 2 hereafter. Provide any R outputs you might have used.
```{r}
ReModel = lm(Profitability ~ RottenTomatoes + DomesticGross, data = hollywoodData)
summary(ReModel)
```

Thus the estimated full first order regression model is:
$$\hat y=0.84+0.031x_1+0.016x_5$$,
where y is Profitability, $x_1$ is RottenTomatoes, $x_5$ is DomesticGross.

#### Problem (4). Use adjusted $R^2$ and forward model selection approach to fit the best first order model for this data. Summarize your R outputs in a table as below. your table should clearly illustrates the step-by-step approach for forward model selection. Once you identify the best model using adjusted $R_2$, fit the model and write down the estimated regression line.

| Variable(s)                                                     | $R^2$    | Adj. $R^2$ |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|
| RottenTomatoes                                                  | 0.024 | 0.015   |
| AudienceScore                                                   | 0.01  | 0.001   |
| TheatersOpenWeek                                                | 0.006 | -0.002  |
| BOAverageOpenWeek                                               | 0.008 | -0.001  |
| DomesticGross                                                   | 0.036 | 0.028   |
| DomesticGross, RottenTomatoes                                   | 0.049 | 0.033   |
| DomesticGross, AudienceScore                                    | 0.037 | 0.021   |
| DomesticGross, TheatersOpenWeek                                 | 0.038 | 0.021   |
| DomesticGross, BOAverageOpenWeek                                | 0.036 | 0.021   |
| DomesticGross, RottenTomatoes, AudienceScore                    | 0.061 | 0.037   |
| DomesticGross, RottenTomatoes, TheatersOpenWeek                 | 0.05  | 0.025   |
| DomesticGross, RottenTomatoes, BOAverageOpenWeek                | 0.05  | 0.025   |
| DomesticGross, RottenTomatoes, AudienceScore, TheatersOpenWeek  | 0.063 | 0.029   |
| DomesticGross, RottenTomatoes, AudienceScore, BOAverageOpenWeek | 0.062 | 0.028   |

Using the adjusted $R^2$, we choose the model with $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_5$ as predictors
```{r}
bestModel = lm(Profitability ~ RottenTomatoes + DomesticGross + AudienceScore, data = hollywoodData)
summary(bestModel)
```

Thus the estimated regression line for the best model that we chose is:
$$\hat y=3.53+0.072x_1-0.084x_2+0.02x_5$$
where y is Profitability, $x_1$ is RottenTomatoes, $x_2$ is AudienceScore, $x_5$ is DomesticGross.
